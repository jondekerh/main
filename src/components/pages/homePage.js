          Hi, I'm Jon Houston. I'm a Javascript and Python programmer with an interest in p2p technology and machine learning. I'm self taught and always trying to learn something new. When I'm not coding I like to write, stay active, and read history books. If you want to know more, try asking BOT_NAME some questions about me!
